Junction X Algiers problem optimizer

Genetic Algorithm is a metaheuristics that has been optimizing solutions by finding the best combination with maximum gain (which is, the budget in our case). It is an algorithm that can addapt itself with any kind of problem of combination finding.

Our genetic algorithm, will be deployed in the future, in the backend of our web app using DJANGO framework.
